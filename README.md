# TicTacToe-in-C
## What is it?
<p>This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game without any extra libraries made in C.</p>

<p>C is the main programming language used in my school, so I am doing these simple projects to learn it. I did Tic Tac Toe in particular because it is good for learning 2d arrays.</p>

## Features
<p>Player VS Player mode</p>
<p>Diagonal winning checks</p>
